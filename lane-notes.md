mission: それぞれのプロジェクトに書いてあるプランに書いてある作業をやること / どのプロジェクトもまず既存のPRを本質的に対処することを作業を優先してください。そうしないと溜まってばっかりなので
model Opus 5.5 (lead, cloud) | advisor absent | github via connector (gh token invalid) | push via git | png ok
goal: unknown (no goal text visible to this lane) | DONE-WAITING satisfies it: unknown
repo rules read: CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md (no .github dir, no PR template, no scrum-board.yml). Stricter: secret-scan 0 before push; 公開前ゲート checklist 全項目; 記事は別AIが点検; 動作確認は npm run build + wrangler dev --local; API キー不使用; 本番 MCP は OAuth のみ
DEPLOY | merge to develop -> nothing | evidence OWNER_TASKS.md:23 (Workers Builds production branch = main; main does not exist), README.md:108 (Worker not created/deployed), wrangler.jsonc:24 (preview_urls false: non-production-branch builds get no public URL); Cloudflare connector read 2026-11-14T12:15Z: the connected account has no Worker ai-eng-blog and no build triggers for it
(no other base branch: main does not exist)

START 2026-11-14T12:12Z | packet part 1/1 received (統括 20:20 JST) | handoff: packet §7 next step = AEB-Q4 done by 統括裁定, then PR #53, #56
worktree /home/user/ai-eng-blog develop clean | nothing unpushed (0 commits ahead of origin/develop)
worktree /home/user/notes notes/ai-eng-blog (NOTES)

DECIDED | develop deploys nothing | reason: repo docs name main as the only production branch and the Worker is not created; connector shows no ai-eng-blog Worker | revert: if the owner reports a Workers Builds connection on develop, stop merges and re-map

## needs owner

## for main session
- no goal is visible on this lane's conversation; please set it (owner: goalは必須)
- advisor tool not present in this lane
- Cloudflare connector is authorized for an account that does not hold this project's Worker; production checks (AEB-D1) will need the owner's account connected
